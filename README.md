# GUIDE FOR ANYONE HAVING AN UNSUPPORTED FILE FORMAT IN THEIR DANCES FOLDER (idk about mobile yet)

1. Pick any song you wanted and download it.
2. Head over to File Explorer, which you know where Downloads are.
3. Select a file, copy/cut it, or drag it over to the Dances folder.
4. Once it has been applied, head over to your executor.
5. Search for any "Sound69.SoundId = customasset("Dances/")" you like to put

       sound69.SoundId = customasset("Dances/EXAMPLE.ogg") 
   
7. Rename the customasset("Dances/") and copy the entire audio file's name.
8. Once you had it applied, you can test it out the script in Just a Baseplate.
